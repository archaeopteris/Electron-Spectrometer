# Electron-Trajectory-Tracker
Program calculates complex trajectory of electron beam (or any other charged particles) in uneven magnetic fields.
Data was used for construction of a mass spectrometer for charged particles to separate them by energy.

Project was done at Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory as part of a Diploma Work for acquiring bachelor's degree.
