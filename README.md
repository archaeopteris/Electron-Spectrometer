# Electron-Trajectory-Tracker
Program calculates complex trajectory of electron beam (or any other charged particles) in uneven magnetic fields.
Data was used for construction of a mass spectrometer for <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\beta&space;^{-}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\beta&space;^{-}" title="\beta ^{-}" /></a>	 radiation from <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=Sr^{90}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Sr^{90}" title="Sr^{90}" /></a> isotope to separate them by energy and have a collimated monochromatic radiation source.
Program 'Tracker.cpp' also performs Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the energy distribution on the output of the device and
energy deviation in obtained collimated monochromatic electron beam.

Project was done at Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory as part of a Diploma Work for acquiring bachelor's degree.
